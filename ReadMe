This is a Matlab implementation for cryo-EM reconstruction over non-uniform distribution of viewing directions.

—————————————

Running the code

The code is using the following 3rd party code, which must be installed and in path:
1 — ASPIRE package, see http://spr.math.princeton.edu/.
2 — Spherical Harmonic Transform Library, see https://github.com/polarch/Spherical-Harmonic-Transform. This collection of Matlab functions is based on the dissertation of Archontis Politis, 2015. The relevant code is attached.

In addition, some of the optimization scripts use ManOpt package, see https://manopt.org/. Thanks Nicolas!
